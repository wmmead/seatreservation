JavaScript seat reservation project

This is a project that I developed for students learning JavaScript. It became a bit larger than I expected, and provided an opportunity for me to learn more JavaScript myself. If you notice any bugs, or best practices that I am not following, please let me know.

The features of the project are quite simple. Given a venue, I want to provide users with a way to reserve seats. 

The JS file has an object at the top that represents fake data coming from a database which represents seats already reserved. Then the user can select seats and add them to that object (and fake putting it back in the database).

I have done my best to handle everything functionally, using best practices.
